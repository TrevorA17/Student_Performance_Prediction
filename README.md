# Student Performance Prediction
This project focuses on predicting student academic performance using machine learning models. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes features such as gender, attendance rate, study hours per week, previous grades, extracurricular activities, and parental support, we built predictive models to estimate students' final grades. Due to the small size of the dataset (only 10 records), we employed Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) to maximize training and evaluation robustness. Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models were trained, with Random Forest ultimately selected as the best-performing model based on RMSE and R-squared metrics. A Plumber API was also developed to allow real-time grade prediction based on new student information inputs.
